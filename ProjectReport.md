# Data Science Project Report: (Insert EGE Use Case Title)

[comment]: # (This document is intended to capture the use case summary for this engagement. An executive summary should contain a brief overview of the project, but not every detail. Only the current summary should be captured here and this should be edited over time to reflect the latest details.)

[comment]: # (Some ideas of what to include in the executive summary are detailed below. Please edit and capture the relevant information within each section)

[comment]: # (To capture more detail in the scoping phase, the optional template Scoping.md may be utilized. If more detail around the data, use case, architecture, or other aspects needs to be captured, additional markdown files can be referenced and placed into the Docs folder)

## Business Understanding
### Customer & Business Problem
 *  Who is the product team, what is their business domain (e.g. hotels, air etc.)?
 * 	What is the business problem (in business terms) that the customer is looking to solve?

### Scope
 * What data science or advanced analytics solutions or product are we building?
 * What are the high level data sources we will be utilizing?
 * How is it going to be consumed by the customer and how will the customer use the model results to make decisions?
 * What are the deliverables?

## Plan
Phases (milestones), timeline, short description of what we'll do in each phase.

### Personnel & primary contacts
[comment]: # (Who is/are assigned to this project)

### Metrics and KPIs
  * What are the qualitative objectives?
  * What is the main quantifiable metric?
  * What improvement in the values of the metrics are useful for the customer scenario?
  * What is the baseline value of the metric before the project?
  * How will we measure the metric?


## Data Understanding
### Data & Analytics Environment
* What are the available data sets and relative size of the data?
* What is the data ingestion method?
* Do we have data needed to answer the business problem?
* What are the data storage/analytics resources (e.g. development resources such as HDInsight)?


## Data Preparation
Document data sources, any useful information about data preparation (that cannot be captured in data prep code comments).


## Modeling
### Model details
  * Feature Engineering steps used?
  * Modeling techniques and methods used, validation results, details of how validation conducted?


## Evaluation
  * Evaluation data and performance (both accuracy and run-time)
  * Assessment of how model will drift with new data


## Deployment
### Architecture
* How will the analytics or machine learning model be consumed in the business workflow of the customer?
* What is the planned data movement pipeline in production?

### CI/CD pipeline

(Insert a diagram showing the end to end data flow and decision architecture.)

## Monitoring
### Architecture
* How will the analytics or machine learning model be consumed in the business workflow of the customer?
* What is the planned data movement pipeline in production?
